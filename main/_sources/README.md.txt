<!--end requires_ansible-->


## Installation and Usage

<!--start galaxy_download -->
### Installing the Collection from Ansible Galaxy

Before using the collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

    ansible-galaxy collection install middleware_automation.infinispan

<!--end galaxy_download -->

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: middleware_automation.infinispan
```


### Build and install locally

Clone the repository, checkout the tag you want to build, or pick the main branch for the development version; then:

    ansible-galaxy collection build .
    ansible-galaxy collection install middleware_automation-amq-*.tar.gz


### Dependencies

#### Ansible collections:

* [middleware_automation.common](https://github.com/ansible-middleware/common)
* [ansible.posix](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/posix/index.html)

#### Python:

The infinispan collection also depends on the following python packages to be present on the controller host:

* lxml
* jmespath

A requirement file is provided to install:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


<!--start roles_paths -->
### Included roles

* [`infinispan`](https://github.com/ansible-middleware/infinispan/tree/main/roles/infinispan): performs an installation of Infinispan or DataGrid nodes or cluster, with configuration of static caches.
* [`infinispan_cache`](https://github.com/ansible-middleware/infinispan/tree/main/roles/infinispan_cache): creates Infinispan or DataGrid caches at runtime.
<!--end roles_paths -->

### Install playbook

* [`playbooks/infinispan.yml`](https://github.com/ansible-middleware/amq/blob/main/playbooks/infinispan.yml) deploys based on the collections defaults.


#### Controller node install zipfile path

By default the collection will download the desired version of the install zipfile to the ansible controller node, then it will distribute to target nodes.


#### Offline from controller node

Making the install zipfile archive available to the playbook working directory, and setting `infinispan_offline_install` to `true`, allows to skip
the download tasks. The local path for the archive does match the downloaded archive path, so that it is also used as a cache when multiple hosts are provisioned in a cluster.

```yaml
infinispan_offline_install: true
```
